; For direct connection to harmonic mixer on WCA use 15 dBm;

; NOTE this setting is now only used for simulation; see tables below.

; Final system will use 4X harmonic, but in the lab we had
; trouble getting sufficient band 6 IF power using a PMP WM,
; so we were using 5X.

; Testing band7 in the lab showed that power input to the harmonic mixers can
; drop off at higher frequencies, requiring extra power output from the signal
; generator to reach the needed ~7dBm.  Since each band has separate cabling,
; each band gets its own dBm lookup table, indexed by LO GHz.
