; This will be used as a safe power level when switching receivers

; -20 dBm is the minimum power output of the E8257D.
safe_dbm = -20

; This depends on whether we are connected directly to the harmonic mixer
; or going through an amplifier.
; direct:    use 14.5 dbm  (seems to be the actual output limit)
; amplified: use  0 dbm

; Final system will use 4X harmonic, but in the lab we had
