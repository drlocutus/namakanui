; This depends on whether we are connected directly to the harmonic mixer
; or going through an amplifier.
; direct:    use 14.5 dbm  (seems to be the actual output limit for Agilent)
; amplified: use  0 dbm (but testing 20191022 used +4.7; 20191030 +7.0)

; in SMA vault, heavy attenuation: use 14.0, Keysight max

; Final system will use 4X harmonic, but in the lab we had
; trouble getting sufficient band 6 IF power using a PMP WM,
; so we were using 5X.
